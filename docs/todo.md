ok so the logic is done with the cli tool, now all that remains is code structering to make it readable. I have created this list of tasks that need execution.
1. The service folder should contain multiple folders of service and have index.ts exporting the required function for better readability.
2. Complete other commands of dao and proposal too. (FUTURE CONSIDERATION: because instructions can be multiple in a single proposal we should give a prompt for choosing which instruction they want to add. just give your thought on this)
